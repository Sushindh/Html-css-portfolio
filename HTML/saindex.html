    Salaar: Part 1- Ceasefire Review: Such is the pace at which the film dishes out the details of its plot and sub-plots, keeping up with it takes some doing.The first half of Salaar: Part 1 is devoted entirely to the story of the burly brooding and invincible Devaratha (Prabhas), his relationship with his mother (Easwari Rao) and his friendship with his pal from 25 years ago, Varadha Raja Mannar (Prithviraj Sukumaran), son of the second wife of the ruler of present-day Khansaar, Raja Mannar (Jagapathi Babu).
